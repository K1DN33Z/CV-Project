      <p>
        I am a full-stack web developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from North-West University.
        I created this page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as using a framework would have been overkill.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also took this as a chance to improve the foundations of web development, as I started off working on big,
        complex websites with my feet hitting the ground using Laravel.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Laravel is my favourite framework to use for full-stack development, but my experience doesn’t stop there!
        I have built 3D mapping tools using React and DeckGL. I have led web development teams of 5–7 people at two
        different companies, giving me leadership experience in managing teams.
        I have done database management for multiple veterinary businesses, and I have been the sole developer of an
        estate management system. I developed an LMS using NestJS and Google BigQuery, focusing solely on the backend.
        And much more.
        <br /><br />
        I speak Afrikaans and English, and I am currently learning Deutsch.

    <h2>My Story</h2>

    <p>
      Unknown year (my memory is a bit hazy from then) – 2018:
      I started working part-time at a security company during high school, doing basic IT tasks—fixing and building
      computers, helping with the setup of wireless transmitters and receivers, installing security camera systems,
      and resolving printer and internet issues for office workers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feb 2020 — Apr 2022:
      I started working for Libralex in my first programming-related job. We used VB.NET for a Windows desktop
      application called Vetmaster, which uses an on-site server at veterinary practices to run their businesses.
      This included inventory, supplier, customer, and patient management, as well as an offline app that syncs data
      with the database. I was also the only programmer on an estate and will-management software used by some lawyers
      in South Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apr 2022 — Oct 2024:
      I moved into web development at CubeZoo, a company that built custom websites for clients based on whatever
      they needed. Here I acquired my love for Laravel and became proficient in it. Not all projects were Laravel-based;
      sometimes we were outsourced and had to learn other frameworks and technologies on the fly, including React,
      DeckGL, NestJS, and Google BigQuery.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oct 2024 — Dec 2025:
      I worked for Prodigy Finance, a global fintech company that provides student loans for learners studying abroad.
      Here we used Ruby on Rails, React, and a micro-service architecture. I also gained experience with Jenkins and
      Terraform.
